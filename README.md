# Hi there :beginner:

** `Data Scientist Canditate (Finance & Economy Master Student @Politecnika Gdansk`**

Well hello there! I'm a data fanatic who's currently in the process of building up my GitHub profile to showcase my love for data and my skills in data science. As an aspiring data scientist, I'm constantly sharpening my data analysis skills with R and Python, and I have some experience with data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. And while I won't pretend to be an expert in everything, I do have some experience with AWS that has proven quite useful in my data endeavors.

Through my GitHub profile, I'm excited to share my passion for data and demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field of data science. And with a quirky sense of humor and a never-say-die attitude, I'm confident that I have what it takes to take on any data challenge that comes my way.

So, if you're looking for a data enthusiast who's skilled, knowledgeable, and not afraid to take risks with new technology, then look no further than me.
